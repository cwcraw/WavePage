    <h1>A Particle in a Webpage</h1>
    <h3>About This Project</h3>
    <p>
      This widget was created as a way to learn Python, particularly numpy,
      matplotlib and Django. It is an exploration of the classic 'particle in a
      box' problem which students encounter in their first semester of quantum
      mechanics or physical chemistry. You will be able to find plots of the
      first six energy levels of the time independent Schrödinger equation here.
    </p>
    <h3>Physics Background</h3>
    <p>
      A 'particle in a box' is a toy system used to introduce students to the
      basics of Quantum Mechanics and the Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger
      Equation describes the behavior of a quantum system, such as an electron,
      in space in time. A key component of the equation is the potential. The
      potential describes the background environment the electron may find
      itself in. If it is near another electron or a nucleus, the potential
      would reflect this.
    </p>

    <p>
      The underlying assumption of a 'particle in a box' is that the particle is
      equally likely to be in any position in side the box, but cannot leave the
      box. The Schrödinger Equation can reflect this by setting the potential to
      zero inside the box and infinity outside the box. You can then solve the
      Schrödinger Equation to get a description of the particles behavior in
      space and time - also known as the wave function. The square of the wave
      function is proportinal to the probibility of measuring a particles
      location at a certain point at a given time. by plotting the square of the
      wavefunction you can determine where you are likely to measure the
      location of the particle.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can make the 'particle in a box' system more interesting by changing
      varying the potential inside the 'box.' Think of this a box with a sloped
      or bowl shaped bottom. In the examples created on this site we have 5
      additional potentials. Three are interesting conceptually to help students
      understand what a wave function is and to demonstrate quantum tunnelling.
      These whould be the step potential and the two barrier potentials. The
      other two examples, the harmonic oscillator and the Morse potential are
      interesting from a chemist's point of view. They represent first steps to
      modelling an electron in an atom. Please visit the demonstrations for more
      details
    </p>

    <p>
      There is one final wrinkle to keep in mind. Particles can have lower or
      higher energy. This will change where a particle is likely to be found -
      that is, the shape of the wave function. In our examples the energy exists
      at discrete values only and the first six values are shown.

      involved.
