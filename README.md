# Wave Function Demonstration page

This widget was created as a way to learn Python, particularly numpy,
plotly and Django. It is an exploration of the classic 'particle in a box'
problem which students encounter in their first semester of quantum
mechanics or physical chemistry. You will be able to find plots of the
first six energy levels of the time independent Schr√∂dinger equation here.

## Project Setup

1. Create a virtual environment using venv: `python -m python3 -m venv venv`
1. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
1. Install the packages in _requirements.txt_: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Start the development web server: `python manage.py runserver`

You should now be able to go to the URL displayed in the terminal.

## Future Plans

- Improve descriptive text to better explain the concepts demonstrated.
- Improve the page layout
- Make the pages mobile responsive
- Add user input to adjust the potentials
