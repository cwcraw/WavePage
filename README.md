# Wave Function Demonstration page

## Project Setup

1. Create a virtual environment using venv: `python -m python3 -m venv venv`
1. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
1. Install the packages in _requirements.txt_: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Start the development web server: `python manage.py runserver`

You should now be able to go to the URL displayed in the terminal.

## Future Plans

- Improve descriptive text to better explain the concepts demonstrated.
- Improve the page layout
- Add user input to adjust the potentials
- Possibly use webpack to bunde bootstrap and plotly
- Possibly move to docker for deployment
